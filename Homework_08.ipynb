    "## Homework 08: Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due:** Midnight on March 23 (with a 2-hour grace period)  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final homework before starting our course project, we will introduce the essential machine learning paradigm of **classification**. We will work with a well-known Kaggle dataset—the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset—to determine whether an individual has diabetes (1) or not (0). This is a binary classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we’ve discussed in this week’s lessons, the classification workflow is similar to what we’ve done for regression, with a few key differences:\n",
    "- Instead of `RepeatedKFold` we use `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` (read the docs to understand the difference)\n",
    "- We use classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) instead of regression metrics--for simplicity we'll just use accuracy in this homework. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you’ll build two models and measure their performance using the accuracy metric. \n",
    "1. A **logistic regression** classifier as a baseline.\n",
    "2. One of the **ensemble** classifiers of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we’ve already covered much of the workflow in our regression assignments, this homework is intentionally concise and less prescriptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 graded problems, each worth 5 points, for a total of 25 points."
